The following is a preview - or an _ad_, if you will - for my new talk "_Sitting in meetings all day long: My first 180 days as a new Software Engineering Manager_" coming soon to a developer conference near you!

### Introduction

In early 2023 I made a decision.
I vowed to quit being an individual contributor (IC) and finally make the transition to engineering management, something I had been interested in for a while.
To my surprise, it only took a couple of months from me publicly declaring said goal on LinkedIn to my first day in my new job as the manager of the software development team of [Phoenix Contact](https://www.phoenixcontact.com/en-pc/)'s Industrial Cabinet Solutions (ICS) business unit.
Taking on this challenge with limited previous leadership experience meant drinking from the proverbial firehose.
It wasn't until the first four or five months had passed that the water pressure finally started to go down.
The following paragraphs are for new managers, ICs considering moving to the management track, and anyone else curious about what's been like for me.
It's not a masterclass (or any kind of class for that matter), but merely a glimpse into my very personal journey from engineering to engineering management.

### Getting ready

So I made a very conscious choice to trade my IDE in for the responsibility of managing a team.
Was I ready?
Sort of.
Certainly in a sense of "as ready as I'll ever be."
But no matter how much (or little) you prepare, there's a huge difference between learning about the theory and best practices of leadership and management, and sitting in a meeting room with your new team for the first time, all eyes on you with a mix of curiosity, expectations, and suspicions.

But back to the beginning.
Readiness aside, how did I know I even wanted to be in that situation in the first place?
Luckily, I had a chance to be a lead developer back in 2016 (or rather, I was appointed to that role without ever having asked for it).
I was not a manager since my responsibilities did not include things like hiring or performance evaluations, but I was arguably more than a tech lead because I had a certain amount of influence over these matters.
The crucial part though was that my focus completely shifted.
While I still worked on tooling and code on occasion, it was only a fraction of what I spent my time on.
Instead, I dealt with process improvements, project management, unreasonable requests from business analysts (and reasonable ones too), and 1-on-1 meetings with the team members.
A lead role similar to the one I had - with or without the "tech" in front of it - is a good first step and trial.
If you enjoy it, you may consider giving up the tech aspect entirely and becoming a full manager.
But if you start to wish already that you had more time to work on architecture and code, don't just not proceed, but reverse course right there and then.

I, for one, enjoyed applying my at that point 10 years of software engineering experience in the background to support and enable a team of developers immensely.
But I was wondering what options there were for gaining a good theoretical foundation.
Unfortunately, this is often an afterthought in the private sector.
My observation has been that manager training is often lacking and is, if at all, not offered until after someone has been appointed and is already doing the job.
Training for aspiring managers is often not available at all.
Luckily, the advent of massive open online courses (MOOC) means that aspiring managers don't have to rely on their employers anymore (though it would be better if they could).
[Coursera](https://www.coursera.org), [edX](https://www.edx.org), and [LinkedIn Learning](https://learning.linkedin.com), just to name a few, each offer a huge catalog of courses available for relative low cost or even for free.
Granted, the quality varies a lot, but with a bit of research you surely can find quality courses that suit your needs.
I chose the (now discontinued) edX _Global Business Leadership and Management_ [MicroMasters](https://www.edx.org/masters/micromasters) consisting of the three courses _Global Leadership and Personal Development_, _Communicating and Negotiating in a Dynamic Global World_, and _Leading Digital and Data Decision Making_.

I also picked up a few books.
This turned out to be even more difficult than picking a MOOC since so much has been written on the topic (and still is).
And similar to MOOCs, the quality of management literature varies a lot.
I ended up reading two that I can recommend.
The first is [_HBR's 10 Must Reads for New Managers_](https://store.hbr.org/product/hbr-s-10-must-reads-for-new-managers-with-bonus-article-how-managers-become-leaders-by-michael-d-watkins/10134).
It's a collection of Harvard Business Review (HBR) articles covering a variety of aspects of management of particular importance to new managers.
The second is [_The Manager's Path: A Guide for Tech Leaders Navigating Growth and Change_](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/the-managers-path/9781491973882/) by Camille Fournier.
Unlike the HBR book it's specifically about software engineering management.

### Leadership and management

Once you're a manager you're expected to, well, manage, but also lead.
Unfortunately, these two terms are constantly conflated.
While certainly related, at least in practical terms, they refer to distinct concepts.
According to Wikipedia, management "[_is the process of managing the resources of businesses, governments, and other organizations_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management)" whereas leadership "[_encompasses the ability of an individual, group, or organization to 'lead', influence, or guide other individuals, teams, or entire organizations_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leadership)."

Let's start with management.
Managing resources means deciding which resources are needed to reach an organization's goals, assigning them to concrete projects or tasks, and continually monitoring and evaluating their performance.
While the term _human resources_ is facing increasing scrutiny and criticism (and arguably for good reasons), it is a technically accurate term.
You need to figure out how many engineers you need to staff all of your projects.
You need to assign those engineers to projects.
And you also need to evaluate the performance of your engineers to determine who needs what support and training as well as how to distribute bonus payments (the latter is not necessarily a given, but a reality at many, if not most, organizations).
But the crucial difference compared to leading is this: As a manager you've been given the authority (and responsibility!) to issue orders.
And you've been given the authority to take disciplinary action if your orders are not followed.

The way I look at it, it's nothing an engineering manager should regularly rely on.
I'm with the late Steve Jobs who said: "_It doesn't make sense to hire smart people and tell them what to do; we hire smart people so they can tell us what to do._"
Granted, like so many things in (an engineering manager's) life, the applicability of this idea depends on the exact context.
I can't expect an intern to come in and "tell me what to do," no matter how smart they are.
And if you see even hints of things like mobbing, you have to step in, even issue formal reprimands if necessary.
But when it comes for example to setting the annual goals for my senior and principal engineers, I let them drive the discussion.
And they come up with some really great ideas what we should be working on.
Which is actually a great segue to leadership.

Honestly, I want to manage my team a little as possible; I want to focus on leading as much as possible.
This means inspiring people, setting an example, and rallying people behind my organization's goals, instead of giving orders.
And this is tricky, because you can't force someone to follow you.
The people reporting to you have to do what you tell them to, because you're the manager.
That doesn't mean they always will, but you're well within your rights to do so and to put people on notice if they don't comply.
But that isn't leadership and nothing I want to spend my time on.

You are a leader if, and only if, you can convince people to follow your lead willingly.
But it doesn't end with you, the manager.
Since a leader is someone people follow, anybody can potentially be a leader; it doesn't require one to become a manager first.
This is known as _leading without authority_ and has two important implications for managers.
First, you need to find out who the informal leaders on your team are, the people who have influence and who are being listened to because they've proven themselves and are respected and trusted.
These are people you want to have on your side because if they aren't they may use their standing, intentionally or unintentionally, to undermine you.
Second, you need to make sure to staff positions that inherently require leadership without authority with people who already are informal leaders or at least show clear signs of having that potential.
These are positions like tech leads and architects, but also principal engineers fall in this category.

### Lessons in communication

Becoming a manager will have a profound impact on how you communicate.
That starts with how people listen to you.
Be prepared for people paying closer attention to what you say.
And interestingly, this most likely won't go just for your direct reports, but also ICs in sister teams and even ICs in other groups you work closely with.
But don't expect this to necessarily mean that you'll get your point across easily.
Sometimes people will zero in on what in your mind was just a little detail or even a one-off comment.
If that little detail turns out to be of particular importance on the receiving end, it may be the information that sticks, regardless of your intent.

And speaking of intent, people will try to read between the lines.
I learnt the hard way that this can go as far as someone assuming a particular, implied intent in what I'm saying, when in fact there wasn't any at all (I was merely asking clarification questions about something I didn't understand).
Now, I don't think there's any way to fully avoid these pitfalls, but being aware of them and attempting to communicate as clearly and purposefully as possible certainly can't hurt.

### What's next?

As a new manager, it's probably a good idea to master your new role.
After all, that's what it is, a new job requiring new skills and a different mindset.
And maybe you'll want to simply enjoy the ride for a while; I don't think there's anything wrong with that.
But if you want to advance in your new management career, there's a fundamental question to answer to ensure that the job experiences you seek out and any additional education will take you in the right direction:
Do you want to move into general management or not?
Or in more concrete terms, is the goal to advance within engineering management and become a director or VP of software engineering, or do you want to become a business or product unit manager with full P&L responsibility and overseeing all functions of that unit?
And I shall leave you with this question as this is very much where I am after my first 180 days, trying to master my new role and figure out where I want to be in a few years (though at the moment I strongly tend to staying in engineering management).
