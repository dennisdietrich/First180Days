When Rachel asked me to write a few paragraphs for the next issue of her _dotInsights_ newsletter, I said "yes."
I said "yes" because I'd given her a couple of "maybes" in the past, and I was afraid doing so again might cut me off from her delicious homemade tiramisu for a while.
And as luck would have it, I'm working on a new talk at the moment titled "_Sitting in meetings all day long: My first 180 days as a new Software Engineering Manager_," so I thought it would be a great idea to summarize the main points for the newsletter.
I ended up with almost 1900 words without even covering everything that'll be in the talk.

This is how I ended up with submitting these two paragraphs you're currently reading and a new article on LinkedIn.
Instead of a preview - or an _ad_, if you will - for an upcoming talk, it's a preview for a preview of an upcoming talk (and, yes, _Inception_ is one of my favorite movies).
In it, I talk about how I got ready for taking on my first manager position, about the differences between leadership and management, and how being a manager will change how you communicate.
So without further ado and for your reading pleasure I present: [_Sitting in meetings all day long: A preview of my first 180 days as a new Software Engineering Manager_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)
