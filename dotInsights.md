When Rachel asked me to write a few paragraphs for the next issue of her _dotInsights_ newsletter, I said "yes."
I said "yes" because I'd given her a couple of "maybes" in the past, and I was afraid doing so again might cut me off from her delicious homemade tiramisu for a while.
And as luck would have it, I'm working on a new talk at the moment titled "_Sitting in meetings all day long: My first 180 days as a new Software Engineering Manager_," so I thought it would be a great idea to summarize the main points for the newsletter.
I ended up with almost 1900 words without even covering everything that'll be in the talk.

This is how I ended up with submitting these two paragraphs you're currently reading and a new article on LinkedIn.
Instead of a preview - or an _ad_, if you will - for an upcoming talk, it's a preview for a preview of an upcoming talk (and, yes, _Inception_ is one of my favorite movies).
In it, I talk about how I got ready for taking on my first manager position by being a lead developer first, taking online courses, and reading books.
I talk about the differences between leadership and management, and how an understanding of leadership, in particular informal leadership, is vital to succeeding as a manager.
And finally, I talk about how communication gets both easier _and_ more difficult as well as things to consider about taking your career to the next level.
So without further ado and for your reading pleasure I present: [_Sitting in meetings all day long: A preview of my first 180 days as a new Software Engineering Manager_](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/sitting-meetings-all-day-long-preview-my-first-180-days-dietrich-7xisf/)
