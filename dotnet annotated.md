The following is a preview - or an _ad_, if you will - for my new talk "_Sitting in meetings all day long: My first 180 days as a new Software Engineering Manager_"

### Introduction

In early 2023 I made a decision.
I vowed to quit being an individual contributor (IC) and finally make the transition to engineering management, something I had been interested in for a while.
To my surprise, it only took a couple of months from me publicly declaring said goal on LinkedIn to my first day in my new job as the manager of the software development team of [Phoenix Contact](https://www.phoenixcontact.com/en-pc/)'s Industrial Cabinet Solutions business unit.
Taking on this challenge with limited previous leadership experience meant drinking from the proverbial firehose.
It wasn't until the first four of five months had passed that the water pressure finally started to go down.
The following paragraphs are for new managers, ICs considering moving to the management track, and anyone else curious about what's been like for me.
It's not a masterclass (or any kind of class for that matter), but merely a glimpse into my very personal journey from engineering to engineering management.

### Getting ready

So I made a very conscious choice to trade my IDE in for the responsibility of managing a team.
Was I ready?
Sort of.
Certainly in a sense of "as ready as I'll ever be."
But no matter how much (or little) you prepare, there's a huge difference between learning about the theory and best practices of leadership and management, and sitting in a meeting room for the first time with your new team, all eyes on you with a mix of curiosity, expectations, and suspicions.

But back to the beginning.
Readiness aside, how did I know I even wanted to be in that situation in the first place.
Luckily, I had a chance to be a lead developer back in 2016 (or rather, I was appointed to that role without ever having asked for it).
I was not a manager since my responsibilities did not include hiring and performance evaluations, but I was arguably more than a tech lead because I had a certain amount of influence over these matters.
The crucial part though was that my focus completely shifted.
While I still worked on tooling and code on occasion, it was only a fraction of what I spent my time on.
Instead, I dealt with process improvements, project management, unreasonable requests from business analysts (and reasonable ones too), and 1-on-1 meetings with the team members.
A lead role similar to the one I had - with or without the "tech" in front of it - is a good first step and trial.
If you enjoy it, you may consider giving the tech aspect entirely and becoming a full manager.
But if you start to wish already that you'd have more time to work on architecture and code, don't just not proceed, but reverse course right there and then.

I, for one, enjoyed applying my at that point 10 years of software engineering experience in the background to support and enable a team of developers immensely.
But I was wondering what options there were for gaining a good theoretical foundation.
Unfortunately, this is often an afterthought in the private sector.
My observation has been that manager training is often lacking and, if at all, not offered until after someone has been appointed.
Training for aspiring managers is often not available at all.
Luckily, the advent of massive open online courses (MOOC) meant that aspiring managers don't have to rely on their employers anymore (though it would be better if they could).
[Coursera](https://www.coursera.org), [edX](https://www.edx.org), and [LinkedIn Learning](https://learning.linkedin.com), just to name a few, each offer a huge catalog of courses available for relative low cost or even for free.
Granted, the quality varies a lot, but with a bit of research you surely can find quality courses that suit your needs.
I chose the (now discontinued) edX _Global Business Leadership and Management_ [MicroMasters](https://www.edx.org/masters/micromasters) consisting of the three courses _Global Leadership and Personal Development_, _Communicating and Negotiating in a Dynamic Global World_, and _Leading Digital and Data Decision Making_.

I also picked up a few books.
This turned out to be even more difficult than picking a MOOC since so much as been written on the topic (and still is).
And similar to MOOCs, the quality of management literature varies a lot.
I ended up reading two that I can recommend.
The first is [_HBR's 10 Must Reads for New Managers_](https://store.hbr.org/product/hbr-s-10-must-reads-for-new-managers-with-bonus-article-how-managers-become-leaders-by-michael-d-watkins/10134).
It's a collection of Harvard Business Review articles covering a variety of aspects of management of particular importance to new managers.
The second is [_The Manager's Path: A Guide for Tech Leaders Navigating Growth and Change_](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/the-managers-path/9781491973882/) by Camille Fournier.
Unlike the HBR book it's specifically about software engineering management.
